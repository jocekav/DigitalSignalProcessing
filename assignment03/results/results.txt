3.4 What is the frequency resolution of the FFT obtained above?
- sampling_rate/N = 44100/11025 = 4.0

3.5 How will the frequency resolution change if you pad the input signal 
with the zeroes length of the input signal?
- sampling_rate/2N = 44100/22050 = 2.0

4.3 Compare the differences in the two plots due to the different windows used
- The rectangle introduces more spectral leakage than a hanning window.
- There is a visible difference in the density 11000-17500 range with the 
    rectanglular window being more dense than the hanning showing more leakage.
    The hanning has more discretely dense points where as the rectanglular is more
    spread out.
